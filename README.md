# CircoCore.js

An actor model in the browser, aka the frontend of CircoCore.

CircoCore.js allows executing CircoCore actors in the browser. It connects to the CircoCore cluster through websockets and integrates with it semi-transparently, meaning that CircoCore.js actors are scheduled in the browser but they can register themself in the cluster to become full-featured CircoCore actors.

This repo also contains the source of "Camera Diserta", the monitoring tool of CircoCore.
